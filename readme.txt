Final Project Structure:

`Final_Report.html`/`Final_Report.rmd`: Our final writeup, including a walkthrough of our three main questions as well as some visual EDA, discussion, and conclusions/future work. Since we used an RMD for our presentation, all of the figures in here are the same as in the presentation. There is much more text and analysis and a deeper explanation of the choices made in these files. 

`data` directory: contains `unprocessed` and `processed` subdirectories, containing all raw data files and then dataframes that we created and cleaned to use in our questions, respectively. `processed` contains more information about the CSVs in that folder.

`EDA.R`: exploratory data analysis for our project

`Question1.R`, `Question2.R`, `Question3.R`, `ExtraQuestionExploration.R`: R scripts used for statistical learning techniques on our 3 main questions explored (plus an extra little one) The majority of this code also appears (hidden) in the presentaiton and report.

`Presentation.html`/`Presentation.rmd`: RMD presentation that we showed in class. Again, this is very similar to our report but without in depth textual analysis at each step.
